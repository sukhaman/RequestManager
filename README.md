# Request Manager

Usage
1. Fetching Data (Decodable)

The fetchData method allows you to make a network request and decode the response into a specified Decodable type.

2. Fetching No Data Response

The fetchNoDataResponse method is used when you expect no data in the response. It ensures the request completes without attempting to decode any response data.
